# SQL Employee Database

A structured SQL project demonstrating relational database implementation and progressive query execution using an Employee schema.

All queries were implemented and tested locally using SQLite in VS Code.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates an Employee Database system and includes:

- Database schema creation
- Constraint implementation
- Sample data insertion
- Basic SQL queries
- Advanced filtering queries
- Aggregate functions
- Nested and subqueries

## 📂 Project Structure

| File Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| README.md | Project documentation |
| schema_creation.sql | Creates EMP table and defines structure |
| constraints_definition.sql | Applies constraints and validation rules |
| sample_data.sql | Inserts sample employee records |
| 01_basic_queries.sql | Basic SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY queries |
| 02_advanced_queries.sql | Advanced filtering and conditional logic |
| 03_aggregate_functions.sql | COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY |
| 04_nested_queries.sql | Subqueries and nested SQL logic |

## 🏗 Database Implementation

### schema_creation.sql
- Creates the EMP table
- Defines data types
- Sets primary key

### constraints_definition.sql
- Implements NOT NULL constraints
- Applies CHECK conditions
- Defines FOREIGN KEY constraints
- Enforces data validation rules

### sample_data.sql
- Inserts sample employee records
- Provides structured test dataset

## ▶ Execution Order

1. Run `schema_creation.sql`
2. Run `constraints_definition.sql`
3. Run `sample_data.sql`
4. Execute query files in order:
   - 01_basic_queries.sql
   - 02_advanced_queries.sql
   - 03_aggregate_functions.sql
   - 04_nested_queries.sql
