# SQL Employee Database

A structured SQL project demonstrating relational database implementation and progressive query execution using an Employee schema.

This repository showcases SQL concepts from schema creation to advanced nested queries.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates an Employee Database system and includes:

- Database schema creation
- Constraint implementation
- Sample data insertion
- Basic SQL queries
- Advanced filtering queries
- Aggregate functions
- Nested and subqueries

All queries were implemented and tested locally using SQLite in VS Code.

## ▶ Execution Order

1. Run `schema_creation.sql`
2. Run `constraints_definition.sql`
3. Run `sample_data.sql`
4. Execute query files in order:
   - 01_basic_queries.sql
   - 02_advanced_queries.sql
   - 03_aggregate_functions.sql
   - 04_nested_queries.sql

---

## 📚 SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- Relational schema design
- Constraint implementation
- Data insertion techniques
- Logical query construction
- Aggregate data analysis
- Nested query execution
- Structured query organization
